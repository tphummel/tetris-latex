The following document is an exhaustive attempt at documenting all facets of The New Tetris. We attempt to cover our history with the game as well as pertenent resources from around the web. Additionally, essays on strategy and ideology referring to TNT explicitly and implicitly follow the history section. Following those, the real meat of this document is our records section - covering the entire official history of our TNT action dating back to 2004.
